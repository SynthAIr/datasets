## Eurocontrol data

The data from Eurocontrol consists of 28 zip files, each corresponding to a specific month and year. The files are named as `YYYYMM.zip`, where `YYYY` is the year and `MM` is the month. The data spans from 2015 to 2021, but only four months (March, June, September, and December) are available for each year.

In each zip file, there are several CSV files. The most important files are:

- `Flights_YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD.csv`: contains the flight data for the specific month. See the [Flights.ipynb](/EuroControl/Flights.ipynb) notebook for more details.
- `Flight_Points_[Filed/Actual]_YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD.csv`: contains the points crossed by the flights in chronological order. See the [flight_Points.ipynb](/EuroControl/flight_points.ipynb) notebook for more details.
- `Flight_FIRs_[Filed/Actual]_YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD.csv`: contains the FIRs (Flight Information Regions) crossed by the flights in chronological order. See the [flight_information_regions.ipynb](/EuroControl/flight_information_region.ipynb) notebook for more details.
  - `FIR_YYMM.csv`: contains information about FIR.
- `Flight_AUAs_[Filed/Actual]_YYYYMMDD_YYYYMMDD.csv`: contains the AUAs (ATC Unit airspace) crossed by the flights in chronological order. See the [AUAs.ipynb](/EuroControl/AUAs.ipynb) notebook for more details.
- `Route_YYMM.csv`: contains information about traffic routes. See the [routes.ipynb](/EuroControl/routes.ipynb) and [route_discrepancy_study.ipynb](/EuroControl/route_discrepancy_study.ipynb) notebook for more details.

### Note:
Currently, the registration/user database is migrated and being worked on. Registration and emails may not work properly for a few days and new accounts could get lost. If you urgently need access, please contact us.


### Description: 
The OpenSky Network is a non-profit community-based receiver network which has been continuously collecting air traffic surveillance data since 2013. Unlike other networks, OpenSky keeps the complete unfiltered raw data and makes it accessible to academic and institutional researchers. With over 30 trillion ADS-B, Mode S, TCAS and FLARM messages collected from more than 6000 sensors around the world, the OpenSky Network exhibits the largest air traffic surveillance dataset of its kind. The mission of our non-profit association is to support open global air traffic research by universities and other not-for-profit institutions.
